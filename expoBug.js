This error occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has a large number of dependencies or a complex build process. It often happens during the build process, particularly when trying to create an Android or iOS build.  The error message itself isn't always very helpful and may vary depending on the specific situation. It might mention a timeout, an out-of-memory error, or other vague system errors.  The underlying cause is usually related to resource exhaustion on your system or within the build process itself.
