# Expo CLI Build Failure: Resource Exhaustion or Timeout Errors

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue encountered when using the Expo CLI to build larger or complex projects. The build process fails with vague error messages hinting at resource exhaustion or timeouts, making debugging challenging. 

This repository provides example code and solutions to help you diagnose and resolve this problem.

**Problem:**

When building your Expo app using `expo build:android` or `expo build:ios`, the build process unexpectedly terminates with unhelpful error messages. These errors might be related to memory limits, process timeouts, or other system constraints.  The errors lack specific details, making it difficult to pin down the root cause.

**Solution:**

Several approaches can help mitigate or resolve these build failures:

* **Increase System Resources:** Ensure your system has sufficient memory (RAM) and processing power.  Closing unnecessary applications and using a machine with higher specs can significantly improve the build process.
* **Simplify Dependencies:**  Analyze your `package.json` and remove any unused or unnecessary dependencies.  Reducing the number of modules involved can streamline the build process.
* **Optimize Project Structure:** A well-organized and efficient project structure can improve build performance. Refactoring complex code modules can sometimes help.
* **Incremental Builds:** If possible, try building smaller portions of your app incrementally rather than building the whole thing at once.  This will help identify specific problem areas.
* **Clean Build Cache:** Before building, try cleaning the build cache using `expo prebuild --clean`. This can remove any corrupted files or settings that might be causing problems.
* **Increase Build Timeout:** In certain cases, you can increase the build timeout setting by adjusting the parameters in your Expo config file, `app.json` or `app.config.js`.
* **Use a Build Server:** Use a build server with more resources, if possible. This is particularly helpful for larger projects or continuous integration pipelines. 
* **Debug the build process:** Use the Expo CLI verbose logging option to check what exactly is causing the failure during the build process.
